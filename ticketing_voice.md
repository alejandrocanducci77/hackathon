## Ticketing Experience – Reimagined

Purchasing a ticket for a football event sometimes is a difficult exercise. You need to search for the ticketing platform that sells the tickets for the event you are interested in, register into their website, select the ticket category, insert your personal and payment data into the system, get the purchase confirmation and print the ticket at home or collect it somewhere the day of the event. The experience is even more complex when you are travelling and you want to attend an event in a different country and you are not familiar with the local language.
Voice can simplify and completely disrupt the ticketing experience. The idea is quite simple and consist in creating a voice solution (ticketing skill) that you can use to purchase tickets for any football event.
I do imagine the skill to be connected/work with all the main different ticketing platforms and that allows you to ask for a specific event without the need to know who is selling the tickets for that event.
The backend of the application/skill will need to connect the APIs of the platforms that sells the tickets and return ticket availability for the requested event to the customer and guide him in selecting the ticket category, price, etc.. Also the payment process will be simplified because the solution/skill will already have the payment methods stored and the customer will be able to finalize the purchase only using its voice when asked to confirm.  

## Experience

The experience could be further enhanced with additional features such as:
-	providing customers daily/weekly updates on upcoming events in a specific location/country;
- reminding customers about dates/timings of events for which the customer bought the tickets;
- offering last minute purchase opportunities;
- providing information about what is the best way to reach the event location based on the current position (especially important when the event is taking place abroad).
